Generative AI holds immense potential for education but suffers from a critical flaw: trust. Standard models often "hallucinate" incorrect facts and fail to align with specific curricula, making them risky for classroom use. We introduce **EduGuard AI**, a comprehensive "Source of Truth" platform designed to guarantee safe, verified, and adaptive learning. Unlike generic chatbots, EduGuard is strictly bound by the user’s uploaded curriculum, such as a textbook or syllabus. It unifies three powerful capabilities into a single solution: **Adaptive Learning**, where a "Complexity Slider" instantly rewrites trusted material to match the learner’s level—transforming complex university concepts into 5th-grade analogies without losing accuracy; **Context-Aware Tutoring**, utilizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to answer queries *only* using verifiable facts from the provided text; and **Real-Time Validation**, where an automated "Critic Agent" cross-references every AI response against the source document, providing page-level citations to prove accuracy. By eliminating the fear of misinformation and ensuring strict adherence to educational standards, EduGuard AI empowers educators and students to utilize the speed of AI with the safety and rigor of a certified textbook.
